Hi! My name is Taylor Sorensen. I'm a Computer Science PhD student at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu), where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/). I research natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) and am especially interested in AI alignment and ethics, large language models, and NLP for social good. I love working with language because I feel it's the best medium we have for communicating and understanding human intelligence, and I'm passionate about understanding how to make AI/language models work for positive world impact.

Previously, I received my BS in [Applied Math and Computer Science](https://acme.byu.edu) at Brigham Young University. I also worked towards an MS, where I worked with [David Wingate](https://science.byu.edu/directory/david-wingate) on a variety of problems ranging from NLP to machine learning to soft robotics until I left to pursue my PhD.

Historically, I've worked on a variety of problems ranging from computer vision to RL for soft robotics to ML-based quantitative investing to NLP for drug discovery.

Value pluralism is the view that multiple correct values may be held in tension with one another (e.g., when considering lying to a friend to protect their feelings, how does one balance honesty with friendship?). As statistical learners, AI systems fit to averages by default, washing out these potentially irreducible value conflicts. To improve AI systems to better reflect value pluralism, the first-order challenge is to explore the extent to which AI systems can model pluralistic human values, rights, and duties as well as their interaction. We introduce ValuePrism, a large-scale dataset of 218k values, rights, and duties connected to 31k human-written situations. ValuePrism’s contextualized values are generated by GPT-4 and deemed high-quality by human annotators 91% of the time. We conduct a large-scale study with annotators across diverse social and demographic backgrounds to try to understand whose values are represented. With ValuePrism, we build Value Kaleidoscope (or Kaleido), an open, light-weight, and structured language-based multi-task model that generates, explains, and assesses the relevance and valence (i.e., support or oppose) of human values, rights, and duties within a specific context. Humans prefer the sets of values output by our system over the teacher GPT- 4, finding them more accurate and with broader coverage. In addition, we demonstrate that Kaleido can help explain variability in human decision-making by outputting contrasting values. Finally, we show that Kaleido’s representations transfer to other philosophical frameworks and datasets, confirming the benefit of an explicit, modular, and interpretable approach to value pluralism. We hope that our work will serve as a step to making more explicit the implicit values behind human decision-making and to steering AI systems to make decisions that are more in accordance with them.}, number={18}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Sorensen, Taylor and Jiang, Liwei and Hwang, Jena D. and Levine, Sydney and Pyatkin, Valentina and West, Peter and Dziri, Nouha and Lu, Ximing and Rao, Kavel and Bhagavatula, Chandra and Sap, Maarten and Tasioulas, John and Choi, Yejin}, year={2024}, month={Mar.}, pages={19937-19947} }
